#In this case study, we will continue taking a look at patterns of flight for each of the three birds in our dataset.

#Part 1

#pandas makes it easy to perform basic operations on groups within a dataframe without needing to loop through each value in the dataframe. The sample code shows you how to group the dataframe by birdname and then find the average speed_2d for each bird. Modify the code to assign the mean altitudes of each bird into an object called mean_altitudes.

# First, use `groupby` to group up the data.
grouped_birds = birddata.groupby("bird_name")

# Now operations are performed on each group.
mean_speeds = grouped_birds.speed_2d.mean()

# The `head` method prints the first 5 lines of each bird.
grouped_birds.head()

# Find the mean `altitude` for each bird.
# Assign this to `mean_altitudes`.
mean_altitudes = grouped_birds.altitude.mean()


#Part 2
#In this exercise, we will group the flight times by date and calculate the mean altitude within that day. Use groupby to group the data by date.
Calculate the mean altitude per day and store these results as mean_altitudes_perday.

# Convert birddata.date_time to the `pd.datetime` format.
birddata.date_time = pd.to_datetime(birddata.date_time)

# Create a new column of day of observation
birddata["date"] = birddata.date_time.dt.date

# Check the head of the column.
birddata.date.head()

grouped_bydates = birddata.groupby("date") ## YOUR CODE HERE ##
mean_altitudes_perday = grouped_bydates.altitude.mean() ## YOUR CODE HERE ##

#Part 3
#birddata already contains the date column. To find the average speed for each bird and day, create a new grouped dataframe called grouped_birdday that groups the data by both bird_name and date.#

grouped_birdday = birddata.groupby(["bird_name", "date"]) ## YOUR CODE HERE ##
mean_altitudes_perday = grouped_birdday.altitude.mean()

# look at the head of `mean_altitudes_perday`.
mean_altitudes_perday.head()


#part 4
#Great! Now find the average speed for each bird and day. Store these are three pandas Series objects â€“ one for each bird.
#Use the plotting code provided to plot the average speeds for each bird.

eric_daily_speed  = grouped_birdday.speed_2d.mean()["Eric"] # Enter your code here.
sanne_daily_speed = grouped_birdday.speed_2d.mean()["Sanne"] # Enter your code here.
nico_daily_speed  = grouped_birdday.speed_2d.mean()["Nico"] # Enter your code here.

eric_daily_speed.plot(label="Eric")
sanne_daily_speed.plot(label="Sanne")
nico_daily_speed.plot(label="Nico")
plt.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()
